    "# **Introduction to Fundamental Data Structures in Pandas**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pandas objects as enhanced NumPy arrays:\n",
    "   * Pandas objects are similar to NumPy structured arrays, but with added features.\n",
    "   * The key difference is that rows and columns in Pandas objects have labels, not just integer indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Three fundamental Pandas data structures:\n",
    "   a. Series\n",
    "   b. DataFrame\n",
    "   c. Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's briefly explain each of these:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Series:\n",
    "   * Can be thought of as a one-dimensional labeled array.\n",
    "   * Similar to a single column in a spreadsheet or a single column of a DataFrame.\n",
    "   * A Series is like a column in a spreadsheet. It's a single list of data, all of the same type, like a list of names or a list of numbers. Each item in the list has a label, called an index, which helps you find that item quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. DataFrame:\n",
    "   * A two-dimensional labeled data structure.\n",
    "   * Like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or multiple Series objects put together to share the same index.\n",
    "   * A DataFrame is like a whole spreadsheet or table. It's made up of multiple Series (columns) put together. Each column can have a different type of data, just like in a spreadsheet where one column might be names (text) and another might be ages (numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Index:\n",
    "   * The object responsible for axis labeling in both Series and DataFrame.\n",
    "   * The Index is like the labels on the side of a spreadsheet\n",
    "   * Allows for easy data alignment and provides a means to identify data.\n",
    "   * An Index in pandas is like the row labels in a spreadsheet. It helps you quickly find and refer to specific rows in your data. By default, pandas uses numbers starting from 0 as the index, but you can use anything as an index - dates, names, or custom labels\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard imports:\n",
    "   When working with Pandas, it's common to start your Python scripts or notebook cells with these import statements:\n"

    "# Python Objects and Pandas Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Objects:\n",
    "1. In Python, everything is an object. This includes numbers, strings, functions, classes, and more.\n",
    "2. An object is an instance of a class. It has:\n",
    "   * Attributes (data)\n",
    "   * Methods (functions that operate on the data)\n",
    "3. Objects are created from classes, which act as blueprints.\n",
    "4. Python uses object-oriented programming (OOP), allowing for encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas Objects:\n",
    "Pandas introduces its own set of objects, built on top of Python and NumPy. The main Pandas objects are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Series:\n",
    "   * One-dimensional labeled array\n",
    "   * Can hold data of any type (integers, floats, strings, Python objects, etc.)\n",
    "   * Similar to a column in a spreadsheet or a single column of a DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DataFrame:\n",
    "   * Two-dimensional labeled data structure\n",
    "   * Like a spreadsheet or SQL table\n",
    "   * Contains columns of potentially different types\n",
    "   * Can be thought of as a dictionary of Series objects\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Index:\n",
    "   * Immutable array-like object holding axis labels\n",
    "   * Used for alignment and identification in Series and DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points about Pandas Objects:\n",
    "* They're built on top of NumPy arrays, providing additional functionality.\n",
    "* They include labels for rows and columns, unlike plain NumPy arrays.\n",
    "* They can handle heterogeneous data types across columns (in a DataFrame).\n",
    "* They have built-in handling for missing data (represented as NaN).\n",
    "* They come with many methods for data manipulation, analysis, and cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relationship between Python and Pandas Objects:\n",
    "* Pandas objects are Python objects, created from classes defined in the Pandas library.\n",
    "* They follow Python's OOP principles but are specialized for data manipulation.\n",
    "* You can use standard Python operations on them, but they also have their own specialized methods.\n",
    "* Purpose:\n",
    "* -Python objects: General-purpose programming\n",
    "* -Pandas objects: Specialized for data analysis and manipulation\n",
    "* Structure:\n",
    "* -Python objects: Can have any structure defined by their class\n",
    "* -Pandas objects: Have predefined structures (Series for 1D, DataFrame for 2D data)\n",
    "* Performance:\n",
    "* -Python objects: Standard Python performance\n",
    "* -Pandas objects: Optimized for numerical operations and large datasets\n",
    "* Data handling:\n",
    "* -Python objects: Manual implementation of data operations\n",
    "* -Pandas objects: Built-in methods for common data operations (filtering, grouping, merging)\n",
    "* Indexing:\n",
    "* -Python objects: Typically use integer indexing for sequences\n",
    "* -Pandas objects: Support label-based indexing, integer-based indexing, and boolean indexing\n",
    "* Vectorization:\n",
    "* -Python objects: Often require explicit loops for element-wise operation\n",
    "* -Pandas objects: Support vectorized operations, applying functions to entire columns or datasets at once\n",
    "* Data types:\n",
    "* -Python objects: Use Python's built-in types (int, float, str, etc.)\n",
    "* -Pandas objects: Use NumPy data types, allowing for more efficient storage and computation\n",
    "* Memory usage:\n",
    "* -Python objects: Each object has its own memory overhead\n",
    "* -Pandas objects: More memory-efficient for large datasets due to underlying NumPy arrays"
